The web based firmare flasher for SlimeVR nRF based smol slimes.

WIP

you can run the backend easily by typing "npm run dev"

for the backend, on request i can provide you with the docker container to run it easily, if you dont want to contact me / i deny your request, you can do it yourself by installing the nrf toolchain, zephyr sdk and slimevr firmware, then edit the directories as appropriate in app.py
